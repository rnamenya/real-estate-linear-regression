## 📌 Project Overview

The goal was to predict house prices using historical real estate data and statistical modeling. I built a **Linear Regression model** in SAS Enterprise to identify key predictors such as square footage, location, number of bedrooms, and age of the property.

The model produced actionable insights to support real estate investment decisions with improved forecasting accuracy and risk awareness.
